                Getting another person to understand your explanation of a complex problem is difficult. So as you could imagine,
                getting a computer to understand a complex problem is even more difficult, because even when they can hear you,
                they have no way of knowing what it is you're saying. To get around this problem, you have to speak their language.
                <br /><br />
                Programming languages are our way of getting computers to understand what specific thing we're asking them to do. Like
                normal languages, programming languages have their own sets of rules and structures designed to allow communication
                in the most effective manner possible.
                <br /><br />
                This website will take a closer look at three specific languages in a bit more depth, and go over a few of their uses.
