                Programming languages can be very visually complex things. The structure of a language is just as relevant to its 
                functionality as the content, and one too many "}" can be the difference between perfectly functioning code and 
                a file full of useless multicolored text.
                <br /><br />
                Enter Python. As a language, Python has fairly minimal structure in the code itself, with little need for brackets
                for starting and stopping, or even specificication when declaring variables. Python will interpret the content
                of the code based on the layout of the code.
                <br /><br />
                Functionally, this means that Python is a very easy language to read and write, regardless of the programmer themselves.
                A language such as C++ can be easy to parse visually if the programmer keeps their code neat, but Python's code is easy
                to parse because it needs to be for it to work at all.
                <br /><br />
                Below is an example of Python code that counts from 0 to 50 in increments of 5, printing it each time.
                <br /><br />
                <code>
                count = 0
                </code>
                <br />
                <code>
                for i in range(10)
                </code>
                <br />
                <div class="indent">
                    <code>
                    count = count + 5
                    </code>
                    <br />
                </div>
                <div class="indent">
                    <code>
                    print(count)
                    </code>
                    <br />
                </div>
                <br /><br />
