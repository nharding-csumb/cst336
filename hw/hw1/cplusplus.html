                When computers were still new, programming languages were incredibly simple. You had to guide the computer through
                every step of the process, and that took a lot of instruction. As one would expect from this description, code was
                incredibly difficult to read for humans.
                <br /><br />
                C was a langage that simplified this code, making it easier to read and write. But it was still a fairly early language,
                and in time a new language was created from C, this one even easier to read and write, C++.
                <br /><br />
                C++ is an object-oriented programming language. What this means is that instead of writing every step of the logic
                the computer needs to follow, it looks at the rules applied to a specific object and how it relates to other objects.
                <br /><br />
                As a language, C++ is very visually simple. Most instructions have only brief declarations, with most of the text of the
                code being the content the user wants to interact with. Below is an example of C++ code that counts from 0 to 50 in 
                increments of 5, printing it each time.
                <br /><br />
                <code>
                int count = 0;
                </code>
                <br />
                <code>
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
                </code>
                <br />
                <code>
                {
                </code>
                <div class="indent">
                    <code>
                    count = count + 5;
                    </code>
                    <br />
                </div>
                <div class="indent">
                    <code>
                    cout &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; endl;
                    </code>
                    <br />
                </div>
                <code>
                }
                </code>
                <br /><br />
