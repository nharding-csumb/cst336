                C++ and Python are used for performing specific computational tasks, but that's not all computers are helpful for.
                Sometimes you don't need to calculate something, you just need to make a webpage with some kind of structure.
                That's were HTML comes in.
                <br /><br />
                HTML is a programming language designed speficially for webpages. It allows someone to give structure and form to 
                a page, to make it easier for visitors to the site to navigate the site and use it for its intended purpose, whatever
                that may be.
                <br /><br />
                HTML is slightly more text-heavy than languages like C++ and Python, but still maintans ease of readability due to 
                its reliance on a system of tags to define what is being displayed.
                <br /><br />
                Below is an example of the HTML code that displays the footer of this page.
                <br /><br />
                <code>
